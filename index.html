            <div class="title-text">Measuring Ethnicity Across Crime Measures</div>
            <div class="intro-text">In a nation that will soon be “majority minority,” there is a serious lack of information on how many Latinos are involved in the criminal justice system. While most states report race (e.g. White, Black, Other) in their prison and arrest records, there are far more holes in data on ethnicity. 
            <br />
            Criminal justice system data are used to develop policies that affect sentencing, prison and jail programming, and reentry services. Without an accurate picture of who is in our justice systems, we cannot make policy that is appropriate for each state’s population. We also cannot accurately track
            <br />
            A state’s failure to report ethnicity in addition to race can even mask racial disparities. A state that only counts people as “black” or “white” would likely label most of their Latino prison population as “white.” Artificially inflating the number of “white” people in prison would make white/black disparities appear less extreme than they actually are. So, comprehensive data around ethnicity doesn’t just affect Latinos.  
            <br />
            Some states may track demographic information but not report it publicly. For data to be useful to policymakers, the public, and advocates, it must be publicly accessible.

  <h1><span class="number">1 </span>Number of Categories with Data on Latinos, by State</h1> 
  <article>
    <p>We tracked all the race and ethnicity information we could find online for each state and D.C., across five categories: prison population; prison population by offense; arrest; probation population; and parole population. We only found one state that regularly reported data on Latinos in all five categories; nearly 50 percent of states (24) have no ethnicity data or only report ethnicity in one category. Only 75 percent of states regularly report data on any of the five measures we tracked.</p>

  <p>Most states collect and report data on Latinos for some, but not all, of the categories we measured. States’ lack of consistency across the criminal justice system illustrates the fact that these data are collected by a variety of state agencies, which may not be well-coordinated. To ensure that Latinos are counted across the criminal justice system, states will have to make sure all of the relevant agencies – from law enforcement, to the department of corrections, to the parole board – are collecting the same data. </p>

      <p>In addition to whether or not a state publishes data on Latinos, we also looked at the quality of state published race and ethnicity categories. “Race” and “ethnicity” are related – in fact, many Latinos (self-report Hispanic as their race…. Etc). For this project, we used the federal government census and guidelines.
      </p>
      <p>Data is best when it tells you more than one thing about a person. For example, the most informative data category in the measures we tracked combines races and ethnicity, in categories such as “non-Hispanic white” and “Hispanic black”. It is also useful to know race and ethnicity data independently from each other at a population level, where individual’s races (e.g. white, black, Asian, etc.) and ethnicities (e.g. Hispanic, non-Hispanic) are reported separately. Slightly less useful is data that combines race and ethnicity into one category, where people are, for example, listed as white, black or Hispanic. So, although Alaska reports data on Latinos in all five categories of data we examined, none of them are at our highest standard. 
      </p>
      <p>States report data on Latinos in their prison population and arrests far more than in the other categories we examined. Even for prison and arrest data, though, hardly any states report at our highest standard. New Hampshire and Vermont report very high-quality data for arrests, as does North Carolina for prison population. No other states meet our highest standards for any of their reported data.

   <h1><span class="number">3 </span>10 States with Largest Latino Population</h1> 
  <article>
    <p>75 percent of the total U.S. Hispanic population lives in the ten states that are the highest percent Hispanic. While we might expect the states with the largest Hispanic populations to be better at reporting ethnicity in their criminal justice data, many of them have significant gaps in data reporting. Florida, New Mexico and California all report less ethnicity data than the average state. Data reporting in these states is especially important, as states with larger numbers of Latinos in the general population are statistically likely to have larger numbers of Latinos in the criminal justice system. Latinos in the justice system in states that do no report data may have unique needs that are not being considered in policy development, because states do not know how many Latinos their policies may impact.
    </p>

    <p>It is possible that states would like to report these data, but are not able to easily capture ethnicity. For instance, in one of these states, a Minority Overrepresentation Committee recommended separating race and ethnicity in data collection on arrests, but then realized it was too difficult to do. [we will elaborate on this].  For now, the state continues to report arrest data by race and ethnicity as a combined category – individuals are listed as White, African American, Hispanic or one of a few other categories.
